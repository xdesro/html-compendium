# The HTML Compendium

This is a sample document you can copy and paste into your blog or other content to test HTML rendering and CSS cascade. It's very simple for now, containing instances of most — but not all — HTML elements in context.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup

None, babey, this is HTML we're talkin' about.

## ✨ How To Use

For right now, you can literally just go to the `index.html` file and copy-and-paste the contents of the `<body>` tag outta there.

## 🚧 For The Future

- [ ] Not all HTML elements are present! We need some valid instances of `<ruby>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, etc.
- [ ] It would be cool to make this interactive. Make a website? Like folks could choose which elements or subsets of elements are present, click-to-copy functionality, etc.
- [ ] I would like to make the first instance of each tag fragment-identified as its name, so you could go to `html-compendium.com#address` or something? Maybe that's not useful. 📺 Stay tuned.
- [ ] Eventually _lorem ipsum_-type samples of different coding languages would be cool to include.
- [ ] More consistent formatting of tags, I think I'm referencing them like three separate ways (e.g. pre, &lt;pre&gt;, and <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> lol).
- [ ] Common embeds (Codepen, Twitter, etc)? Links to HTML styling resources?
