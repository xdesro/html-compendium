# The HTML Compendium

This is a sample document you can copy and paste into your blog or other content to test HTML rendering and CSS cascade. It's very simple for now, containing instances of most ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî HTML elements in context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Setup

None, babey, this is HTML we're talkin' about. \*\*slaps roof of programming language\*\* This puppy can fit so much <del>fuckin</del> progressive enhancement in it.

## ‚ú® How To Use

For right now, you can literally just go to the [`index.html`](https://github.com/xdesro/html-compendium/blob/main/index.html) file and copy-and-paste the contents of the `<body>` tag outta there.

## üöß For The Future

- [ ] Not all HTML elements are present! We need some valid instances of `<ruby>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, etc.
- [ ] It would be cool to make this interactive. Make a website? Like folks could choose which elements or subsets of elements are present, click-to-copy functionality, etc.
- [ ] I would like to make the first instance of each tag fragment-identified as its name, so you could go to `html-compendium.com#address` or something? Maybe that's not useful. üì∫ Stay tuned.
- [ ] Eventually _lorem ipsum_-type samples of different coding languages would be cool to include.
- [ ] More consistent formatting of tags, I think I'm referencing them like three separate ways (e.g. pre, &lt;pre&gt;, and <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> lol).
- [ ] Common embeds (Codepen, Twitter, etc)? Links to HTML styling resources?
